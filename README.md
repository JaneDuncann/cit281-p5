# Project 5


## Purpose of the project
In this project, we constructed a Monster Game which uses classes and gives monsters initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to stay alive. Once the game has begun, there will be a delay and then the monsters life will be drained by a random amount. The game continues until all monsters have died. This project gave me a lot of experience working with classes and methods.
